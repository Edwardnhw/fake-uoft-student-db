-- ANALYSIS I. Admission Analysis:
-- 1. Calculate the total percentage of applications that have been admitted out of all applications received.
--    (Note: "applications received" -> should not contain application_status = 'not-submitted')
-- 2. For all admitted applications, determine the ratio of those that were accepted, declined, or pending.
-- 3. Verify that every admitted application also exists in the 'admission_offer' table; if not , return the missing applications id.

-- ANALYSIS II. INF Teaching Staff Workload details in 2024:
-- Find all the INF courses (sections and tutorials) in 2024 
-- and list out all the teaching staff responsible for them. 
-- The returned table should include information of the teaching staff (id, first and last name),
-- their position (professor/teaching_assistant), the course code and course name, 
-- the term it takes place, and the type (section/tutorial) they are responsible for.

-- ANALYSIS III. Enrollment Analysis:
-- 1. For a specific student (William Chen, student number: S20240001), calculate the total number of credits earned each year.
-- 2. Analyze the distribution of his enrolled credits across the various faculties offering the courses, per year.
-- Note: William began his studies in 2023, even though his student number contains '2024'â€”the reason for this discrepancy is outside the scope of this project.
